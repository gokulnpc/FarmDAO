# 🌾 FarmDAO — Decentralized Crop Insurance & Governance on Polkadot 🌾

## 🌟 Overview

FarmDAO is a decentralized insurance and governance platform revolutionizing agricultural insurance through smart contracts, Chainlink oracles, and DAO-driven dispute resolution on the Polkadot network.  
Farmers purchase parametric crop insurance policies using stablecoins (FUSD), represented as NFTs, ensuring transparent, automated coverage against real-world weather events.  
In the case of disputes, token holders vote via a decentralized governance system, ensuring fairness, transparency, and economic incentives for honest participation.
